# rector-p partial rector execution

## install

`composer req andersundsehr/rector-p`

## Why should you need this?

if you have a large old project and want to use rector, it can be a pain to convert the whole project at once.
So you can use rector-p to convert the project file by file.
you will get asked for each file that has changes if you want to apply them.

## Example

`rector-p`
